		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 5%;">My name is Kenny Nguyen and I am a digital media artist studying at San Jose State University. I selected Digital Media Art as my major because of my great interest in art and the fact that I am able to incorporate it into the digital world. People have advised me to pursue an art major because of my passion for art. Others have advised me not to because they believe I will be more successful with a major like computer engineering or nursing. However, I went with Digital Media Art because that is what I believe I enjoy doing the most compared to other academic studies.</p><br>
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 5%;">I am determined to earning my degree and maintaining a successful career afterward. For every task and assignment that is given to me, I will ensure that I follow instructions carefully and exhibit my creative skills to make each project my own. So far, the biggest challenge I have had in the field of art so far is brainstorming my own original ideas for art projects. I still manage to successfully do it in the end; however, it is not as quick as my peers and certainly not as quick as I would have liked. I believe that the DMA program will help me overcome this challenge. It may not be easy. It may take some time. But as I said before, I am determined to do what it takes to earn my degree.</p><br>
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 5%;">Before enrolling in college, my artistic interests included 3D modeling, drawing, and using applications like Paint 3D. Since then, they have expanded to photography, sculpting, and coding in HTML and CSS for web development. I enjoyed coding so much to the point where I tend to add unnecessary features that I personally find visually appealing. The intentions behind my work are to inform viewers of my personal interests and the artistic skills I am most proficient in.</p><br>
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 5%;">The career choices I am leaning towards the most are motion graphics designer, game programmer, and software developer. I believe that I would be pleased with most of the career options available to me. Whichever career path I decide on, Digital Media Art will help me with obtaining the skills necessary as well as overcoming my challenges. I will learn to improve my programming skills, which is one of the most important skillsets I aspire to be proficient in. Other skills include website creation and working on multiple editing platforms, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Photoshop.</p><br>
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 5%;">To conclude, my future career requires outstanding expertise in Digital Media Art, which I will strive to master the best I can. My primary focus is on doing well in my Digital Media Art courses so I can maximize my potential in the art world as well as a successful career path.</p><br>
