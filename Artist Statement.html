		<p style="color: white; font-size: 19pt;">My name is Kenny Nguyen. I have a profound interest in pop culture and sports, which I incorporate into my work when possible. When learning new skills from those who are more experienced, I exhibit my creative skills to make each project my own. My work is never produced without challenges. Indeed, one of the greatest challenges I have had is brainstorming my own ideas. I know that the more progress I make, the easier it will be for me to overcome this challenge.</p>
			<br>
		<p style="color: white; font-size: 19pt;">Before becoming a DMA student, my artistic interests included 3D modeling, drawing, and using simple applications like Paint 3D. Since then, they have expanded to  sculpting, woodworking, game design/development and web design/development. My work intends to inform audiences of my personal interests and the artistic skills I am most proficient in. Programs I have used include but are not limited to Atom Text Editor, Sublime Text, Github, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Lightroom, and Adobe Illustrator.</p>
			<br>
		<p style="color: white; font-size: 19pt;">Several career opportunities are lying in wait and I strive to expand my skillset and knowledge as much as possible for my future. The greater the variety of mediums and materials that I work in, the more successful my work be.</p><br>
