		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 6%;">Through Sublime Text 3, I created an HTML/CSS website including basic personal information, my contact information, and most importantly, all of my works in my Art 74 class. This last part is essentially a portfolio of my projects. There are six projects that I have done and these are the augmented glitch art, the 3D mashup of OBJ models, the video and sound art group project, the net art animation, the self-portrait through processing, and the animation through processing. With a clear navigation bar at the top of the website, viewers can easily navigate to five different pages: “Home, Portfolio, Artist Statement, About, or Contact.” The color scheme makes the website visually appealing and not distracting from the information provided. There are direct links to each of the projects on the ‘Home’ page as well as the ‘Portfolio’ page. The ‘Home’ page displays four of my favorite photographs that I’ve taken for my photography class, which is another form of art I am interested in. Overall, the website is fairly organized.</p><br>
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 6%;">In my first project, the augmented glitch art, I compiled six photographs, all of which I took myself, into a digital collage with Adobe Photoshop. I added in the glitch aspect with Audacity, viewable through the Blipp AR app. I made my next project, the 3D mashup, with Meshmixer. I included dogs, an elephant, and a gremlin who are all playing with a ball in the middle. There were more objects but I had to remove them in order to upload them to Sketchfab. My third project is a video is about Ramon Franco observing various artworks in the San Jose Museum of Art. He casually enters the museum and examines several art galleries. I did the filming in the museum and provided the background sounds to ideally fit the video clips. My fourth project is the Net Art Animation. I created this animation with ThreeGUI - WebGL Renderer. I used three or four snippets to rotate the star-shaped object, move it back and forth, and change background colors. I did not have a concept idea behind this project but ended up liking the final outcome. My fifth project is the Self-Portrait through Processing. I used basic 2D shapes to create each feature of my face. Included are my glasses, my gray hat, and multiple lines on the edge resembling the portrait’s frame. My last project is the Animation through Processing. This animation is an artwork representing Marvel superheroes. For example, the moving picture in the middle is the Avengers logo and the objects on the sides are Captain America’s shield and Iron Man’s helmet.</p><br>
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 6%;">By viewing this website, I hope the audience will get a better sense of what kind of artist I am. I hope they realize that I have put a lot of effort into making this website. I want the audience to think, “Wow! I am truly in awe of how well he created this website and how well he incorporated all of his Art 74 projects into it.” As for me, I really enjoyed working on this website and I am very proud of the final outcome.</p>
