		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 6%;">Through Sublime Text 3, I created an HTML/CSS website including basic personal information, my contact information, and most importantly, all of my works in my Art 74 class. This last part is essentially a portfolio of my projects. There are six projects that I have done and these are the augmented glitch art, the 3D mashup of OBJ models, the video and sound art group project, the net art animation, the self-portrait through processing, and the animation through processing. With a clear navigation bar at the top of the website, viewers can easily navigate to five different pages: “Home, Portfolio, Artist Statement, About, or Contact.” The color scheme makes the website visually appealing and not distracting from the information provided. Overall, the website is fairly organized.</p><br>
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 6%;">In my first project, the augmented glitch art, I compiled six photographs, all of which I took myself, into a digital collage with Adobe Photoshop. These pictures are of my toy animals, my camera lens, the San Jose State volleyball/basketball gym, my penny board, and two pictures from a bird’s eye view and bug’s eye view. After adding multiple layers, the changes I made to the digital collage are adjustments to the brightness, contrast, and saturation. And I added in the glitch with Audacity, viewable through the Blipp AR app. I made my next project, the 3D mashup, with Meshmixer. I included dogs, an elephant, and a gremlin who are all playing with a ball in the middle. There were more objects but I had to remove them in order to upload them to Sketchfab. I did not really have a concept behind this project. 
		<p style="color: white; text-indent: 6%;">My third project is a video is about Ramon Franco observing various artworks in the San Jose Museum of Art. He casually enters the museum and examines several art galleries. Ramon is the only actor in this video. Ramon and Jigme did most of the video editing, such as trimming, speed, etc., because they have the most experience. I did the filming in the museum and provided the background sounds to ideally fit the video clips. There is no music and Ramon does not talk in the video. We used a tripod to keep the video still. My fourth project is the Net Art Animation. I created this animation with ThreeGUI - WebGL Renderer. I used three or four snippets to rotate the star-shaped object, move it back and forth, and change background colors. I did not have a concept idea behind this project but ended up liking the final outcome. My fifth project is the Self-Portrait through Processing. I used basic shapes to create each feature of my face. I added in my rectangular glasses with no transparency and a gray hat that is placed on top of my head. There are also lines on the edge resembling the frame of the portrait. My last project is the Animation through Processing. This animation is an artwork representing Marvel superheroes. For example, the moving picture in the middle is the Avengers logo and the objects on the sides are multiples of Captain America’s shield and Iron Man’s helmet.</p>
