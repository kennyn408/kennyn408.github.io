		<p>Hi, my name is Kenny Nguyen. I am currently a 19-year-old student attending San Jose State University. I am a freshman with a major of Digital Media Art. I do not know yet what I want to pursue after graduating college but I am willing to accept advice and suggestions from peers and family. The high schools I attended are LPS San Jose High School and DCP Alum Rock High School. I attended each of them for two years.</p>
			<br>
		<p>I enjoy playing sports, mostly soccer, in my free time. I like to watch soccer, movies, and TV shows. My favorite professional soccer team is FC Barcelona. The TV shows I like to watch are The Walking Dead, Arrow, and The Punisher. The movies I like to watch are superhero movies, especially the Avengers movies. My favorite superhero is Captain America.</p>
			<br>
		<p>I created this webpage for my project in my Art 74 course. I was surprised to find out that I am the only freshman in this class. I believe this is the hardest but most creative project so far in this class. I've taken 16 units last semester and currently taking another 16 units this semester. I also plan to take more courses in the summer. Either that, or I will apply for my first-ever part-time job.</p></div>
